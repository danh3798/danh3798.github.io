Beatup Editor JS - by caohanh1502

Please use Google Chrome to open "BeatupEditorJS.html" file.

This is an offline version of Beatup Editor on my old website
(http://caohanh.com/beatup/editor/), written in javascript.

If you host this on your own website, it might not work correctly on some devices
(especially on iOS devices) because I removed some codes so it's completely offline.

If you have any questions, please contact me:

- Email: caohanh1502@gmail.com

P/s: Due to my lack of coding experience, this app might not work well 8-}
